  **1.** Go to [my page][my TIC-80 page] on the [official TIC-80 site][TIC-80 site].

  **2.** Then click on the chosen cart and enjoy it.

* **To download the cartridges and use their code:**

  **1.** [Download](https://tic80.com/create) and install the TIC-80 on your device.

  **2.** In the software, type `folder` on the console and press ENTER to appear on the screen the storage path. It is where you access the .tic files(the cartridges).
